# Jupyter-TechNotes

Jupyter-TechNotes is a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that explain technical topics, problems, and concepts. 
Covering areas like engineering optimization, operations research, data analysis, and machine learning, this repository serves as both a personal resource and a portfolio of practical skills.

## List of TechNotes:

* [Minimum Volume Truss Topology Optimization](truss-optimization/minimum-volume-problem.ipynb) 
* [Design of Branching Networks](pipe-topology-optimization/branching-networks.ipynb)
* [Basic Branch-and-Bound Algorithm based on `Pyomo`](branch-and-bound/branch-and-bound.ipynb)

## Planned topics

1. Ordinary least squares in log-space ([see feature branch](https://github.com/marvin-meck/Jupyter-TechNotes/tree/feature/ols-log-space))
2. McCormick envelopes
3. Outer approximation
4. Phase equilibria via direct Gibbs energy minimization
5. Continuous bilinear terms to avoid big-M constraints
